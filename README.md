# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Detecting fraudulent transactions with extreme class imbalance (0.17% fraud rate).

## Challenge
- 284,807 transactions
- Only 492 frauds (0.17%)
- 160x more imbalanced than typical classification problems

## Progress
- [ ] Day 1: Load data, understand extreme imbalance
- [ ] Day 2: Baseline failure analysis
- [ ] Day 3: SMOTE and undersampling
- [ ] Day 4: Class weights with XGBoost
- [ ] Day 5: Threshold tuning
- [ ] Day 6: Precision-recall curves
- [ ] Day 7: Anomaly detection + business recommendations

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **imbalanced-learn** (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
